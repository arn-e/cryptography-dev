###Basic Cryptography Examples and Work

This repo contains the working code for fairly elementary cryptographic cipher work.

It started as a learning game experiment which was intended as a basic substitution  
cipher. It has since been expanded to include character frequency analysis and polyalphabetic  
cipher encryption & decryption.

Some of the methods are expository, such as encrypt_single, as well as the reverse  
(decrypt_single).  They were created to act as stand alone code snippets to augment  
a series of blog entries I am making on the subject.

Topics covered to date :

*  Caesar Cipher / Basic Substitution Cipehr
*  Polyalphabetic Cipher
*  Character Frequency Analysis (incl. first char in word)
